## How to use

### Snippet

> Snippets are a small pieces of code to use if you already have a existing webpage (or webshop via a CMS)

This is about the file: ``` unrelated_return.html.snippet```


step 1. Get your MyParcel API key.

step 2. Fill in your API key in the script:

```
var myParcelApiKey = "MYPAk8xeGA6yU5APIe8abMF8fn6xFWYneuZ1Key0"; // your API key
```

step 3. Copy & Paste the snippet to your webpage.

step 4. (Optional!) Customize the text-color and background color.

The standard button background is Orange with a white text-color.

```
background-color: orange;
color: white;
```

_Do you want a button with a pink background and black text?_  **No problem!**

Change the ```background-color``` "orange" to pink (#ff00aa)  
change the ```color``` "white" to black (#000000)  

it should look like:

```
background-color: #ff00aa;
color: black;
```

or

```
background-color: #ff00aa;
color: #000000;
```

Repeat **step 3** (Copy, Paste and Upload the new version to your webpage)
